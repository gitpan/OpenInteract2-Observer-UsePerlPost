INTRO: OpenInteract2::Observer::UsePerlPost
========================================

This is an Observer within the OpenInteract2 framework that will post
an object to your use.perl journal. The actual module is fairly simple
glue since we're just reacting to an event published by OI2 and the
posting is done for us by Net::Blogger


INSTALLATION
========================================

The standard:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make 
 make test
 make install


QUICK START
========================================

Step 1.

# In $WEBSITE_DIR/conf/observer.ini

# Declare the observer

[observer]
...
useperl = OpenInteract2::Observer::UsePerlPost

# Map the observer to an action 'news'
[map]
useperl = news

Step 2.

Glue your action to the observer:

 [news]
 ...
 use_perl_subject  = subject
 use_perl_content  = news_item
 use_perl_user_id  = 9999
 use_perl_password = sekrit

Step 2 1/2. (optional)

Add a footer to the content to be posted:

 [news]
 ...
 use_perl_footer = <p>Posted from <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/>cwinters.com</a>; <a href="$LINK">read original</a></p>

Step 2 2/3 (optional)

Set debugging to on, which means the article will not be posted but
you'll see in the log the data that would have been sent.

 [news]
 use_perl_debug = yes

Step 3.

Restart the server and create new 'news' objects.

Step 4.

Profit!
